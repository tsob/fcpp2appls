fcpp2appls
==========

A modification of faust2appls which inputs a Faust-style C++ file and
(a) integrates with a specified architecture file, then
(b) compiles to that architecture.

Development is ongoing - fcpp2jack is the only currently working for of the
faust2appls family. architecture_mergy.py is working as a general integrator
of the general Faust-style C++ code with a specified architecture file.
